# 🔧 FIX FOR 404 ERRORS - URL FORMAT ISSUE

## ❌ WHAT YOU DID (Wrong)
```
Typed in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/student-login/
Result: 404 Page not found
```

## ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO (Correct)
```
Correct URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/student/login/
Result: Works perfectly ✅
```

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

You typed `/student-login/` (with a dash between student and login)

**But the correct URL is `/student/login/` (with a slash between student and login)**

---

## 🔍 WHY THIS HAPPENS

Your Django URL structure is:

```python
path('student/', include('student.urls')),
```

Then inside `student/urls.py`:
```python
path('login/', views.student_login, name='student_login'),
```

So Django combines them:
- `/student/` + `login/` = `/student/login/` ✅ (CORRECT)
- NOT `/student-login/` ❌ (WRONG)

---

## ✅ ALL CORRECT FORMATS

### Student Routes (NO DASHES)
```
✅ /student/login/
✅ /student/dashboard/
✅ /student/logout/
```

### Lecturer Routes (NO DASHES)
```
✅ /lecturer/
✅ /lecturer/login/
✅ /lecturer/register/
✅ /lecturer/dashboard/
✅ /lecturer/upload-results/
✅ /lecturer/logout/
```

### Admin Routes (NO DASHES)
```
✅ /officer/login/
✅ /officer/dashboard/
✅ /officer/faculties/
✅ /officer/departments/
✅ /officer/results/
✅ /officer/notifications/
✅ /officer/reports/
✅ /officer/logout/
```

---

## ❌ INCORRECT FORMATS (All Will Give 404)

These will NOT work:
```
❌ /student-login/        ← Should be /student/login/
❌ /lecturer-home/        ← Should be /lecturer/
❌ /lecturer-login/       ← Should be /lecturer/login/
❌ /admin-login/          ← Should be /officer/login/
❌ /admin-dashboard/      ← Should be /officer/dashboard/
```

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICE

**Don't type URLs manually!** Instead:

1. Go to home page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Click the appropriate button (Student, Lecturer, or Admin)
3. The correct URL will be used automatically ✅

## 📝 SUMMARY

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Wrong Format** | `/app-action/` or `/app-action-subaction/` |
| **Right Format** | `/app/action/` or `/app/action/subaction/` |
| **Separator** | Forward slash `/`, NOT dash `-` |
| **Best Practice** | Click links on pages, don't type URLs |

---

## ✨ REMEMBER

- Use **forward slashes** (`/`) not **dashes** (`-`)
- Structure: `/appname/endpoint/`
- Always click links from the home page

**Now try accessing the correct URL and it will work!** ✅
